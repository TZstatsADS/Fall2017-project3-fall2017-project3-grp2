Summary: 

[Contribution Statement] 

+ Yiran Li:
  + Designed the workflow, arranged meetings and delegated tasks.
  + Created the training, testing, and cross validation function for Random Forest. The cross validation function calculates
  and compares the cv errors and running time of various n_tree values. 
  + Produced the PCA function and sample code for dimension reduction to a user-specified number of features.
  + Ran cross-validation on Neural Net on PCA-processed SIFT, Random Forest with IBP, SIFT, and PCA-processed SIFT, resulting
  in classification accuracy of 70.7%, 70.4%, 74.7% and 79.3% respectively. 
  + Created main.rmd.
  
+ Qingyun Lu: 
  + Worked on HOG features extraction method.
  + Worked on XGBoost method for 3-classes classification.
  + Tried XGBoost with SIFT + PCA, SIFT, HOG, IBP, GRAYSCALE, GRAYSCALE + SIFT + PCA.

+ Enrique Olivo:

+ Saaya Yasuda: 

+ Qihang Li: 
  + Got the SIFT features with original Matlab code
  + Extracted LBP features using Matlab
  + Extracted Grayscale features using R
 Â + help organized GitHub directory
